This DSL is still under construction and its public API is changing drastically.

Please use at your own risk, or wait until we consider it more stable for public use.

These are the Kotlin bindings for the [ContractCase contract testing framework](https://case.contract-testing.io/). It
exists for making ContractCase usable in idiomatic Kotlin.

Since [Jsii does not currently support native Kotlin](https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/1541), this DSL also only
supports JVM target for Kotlin. Other multiplatform targets may be supported in the future if implemented by AWS. If
there is enough interest, we may decide to map `expect/actual` implementations directly here.

Read the [documentation here](https://case.contract-testing.io/docs/intro/).
